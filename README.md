# Dotfiles

My configuration files for bash, Neovim, Alacritty and tmux and so forth.

The intention is to be able to run a setup script after cloning the repo on a Mac or Linux system and be up and running very quickly.

There is far better and optimal ways to do this: NixOS System Configurations & flakes, Ansible, Dotbot, chezmoi etc
